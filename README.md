# Stegonography_Text_Hiding
I build an GIU with pyhton for encoding and decoding texts into images with steganography.

Before using this code you have to download the library 
command prompt > : -pip install stegano

After that you can upload an jpg or png file than enter the message for encytption then click the hide button and save image. 

Now you have a hidden picture with message and for decoding the image  click the open image button and select your hidden image and click show data to read your hidden message.
